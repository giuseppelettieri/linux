/*
 Support for virtio-like communication.
 1. the guest allocates the shared Communication Status Block (csb) and
    write its physical address at CSBAL and CSBAH (offsets
    0x2830 and 0x2834, data is little endian).
    csb->csb_on enables the mode. If disabled, the device is a
    regular one.

 2. notifications for tx and rx are exchanged without vm exits
    if possible. In particular (only mentioning csb mode below):

 TX: host sets host_need_txkick=1 when the I/O thread bh is idle.
     Guest updates guest_tdt and returns if host_need_txkick == 0,
     otherwise dues a regular write to the TDT.
     If the txring runs dry, guest sets guest_need_txkick and retries
     to recover buffers.
     Host reacts to writes to the TDT by clearing host_need_txkick
     and scheduling a thread to do the reads.
     The thread is kept active until there are packets (with a
     configurable number of retries). Eventually it sets
     host_need_txkick=1, does a final check for packets and blocks.
     An interrupt is generated if guest_need_txkick == 1.
